// Single record writes always ommit empty fields and ignore the onEmpty setting.
//
// The Col type parameter is typically an entry of a protocol buffers enum with columns names. (must implement the String() method).
// The Record type parameter should be a protocol buffer message representing the databae schema.
// Column names must match with field names, case sensitive.
// It is recommended to define a field for each column, for usage with the wildcard operator '*'.
// It is safe to have more fields than columns, the surplus will be ignored.
// See pbpgx.Scan for details.
// The ID type parameter should match the type used in "id" column of the table,
// used to match a single row in Read, Update and Delete.
